## [Project 1: World Bank funding trends over the past 3 years]()

This is a project that I did in a bootcamp wherein I was tasked to deliver a well-structured presentation that highlights the key trends in World Bank funding over the past three years.
* Data was provided and compiled in https://iatistandard.org using the "World Bank" filter
* Python was used to streamline data preparation by removing unnecessary columns, merging tables, splitting comma-separated values in cells, and aggregating data for analysis.
* Power BI was used to create clear visuals showing funding trends for each country. DAX formulas were also used to add new columns, making the analysis easier to understand.
## [Project 2: A Comparative Study Using Machine Learning and Flood Data to Predict Floods]()

I Participated in an undergraduate thesis titled: A Comparative Study Using Machine Learning and
Flood Data to Predict Floods
* Managed the collection and consolidation of flood data from various agencies such as PAGASA, MMDA, and EFCOS in Metro Manila utilizing Microsoft Excel.
* Utilized python to analyze data by applying machine learning techniques such as random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural networks.
* Incorporated seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization
* Developed a python-based Streamlit application to predict potential flood heights by analyzing datasets on rainfall, temperature, wind, and average flood events
